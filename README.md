# Project chat-bot

The assignment was to create a chat-bot using javaScript.

## The problem

Used DOM-selectors, Conditional statements, functions and eventListeners to navigate the program.
Started with basic flow-chart in figjam, then pair-programmed through VScode liveshare.
If we had more time we would slim down our code and also focus more on getting the setTimeOut to work.
